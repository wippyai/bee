# Bee sessions

`bee.sessions` owns the public session contracts, executor selection, readiness
location and work scheduling. Threads owns the durable session journal and
transactional work, claim, turn and result records; Sessions never writes its
tables. Executors are selected by the host and operate through the fenced
worker contract.
